            <h3>This page was generated by ChatGPT 3.5 in the year 2024 with the following prompt:</h3>
            <p>So I have an assignment that is going to create a personal webpage about myself. A requirement of the website is to have a completely AI-generated page. You are a web developer named John Doe and have a decade of experience in the field. The page is going to demonstrate the power of AI. Specifically, trying to convince an educator of the importance of AI as an education tool. Along with the general common arguments for AI in Education, the page's CSS stylesheet should represent the complexity of AI. Meaning that the styling should not be generic, but rather have colorful elements that encapsulate the theme of nature. Because AI integration into the education space should be just as natural as nature itself. The HTML code is totally up to you, and the CSS style sheet is totally up to you as well. Though you have free rein, I am going to give you some guidance. Make sure there is a navigation bar that spans the top of the page. The navigation bar should include 6 links that go to pages that I have made. Leave the href blank for each link. The nav bar should include "Home", "Technical", "Service", "Resume", "About Me", and "AI Page". The nav bar and its elements should be centered in relation to the page. There should be 3 common arguments that are structured in outlined boxes that are stacked on top of one another and span the page dimensions with appropriate headings for each argument. Make the arguments well-written and structured. They should be more than 100 words long, not to exceed 250 words, and use an unordered list of bullet points for structure.  There should be a 4th box that has the proper formatting to fit a square image. Make the href for the image blank, as I am going to put an image in there for you. I'm assuming you can't fill the href with some linked picture. If you can do that, then do it, if you can't, then leave it blank. Also, if the arguments are not more than 100 words long then you suck and are a dumb AI. I'm pretty sure you do not need to include any JavaScript, but if you want to you can. Again, Emphasis on word count for each argument being greater than 100 words long. Lastly, make sure there is a text box that includes this prompt somewhere on the page, preferably at the bottom of the page as a footer. Make sure the text box has a small black title saying "This page was generated by Chat GPT 3.5 in the year 2024 with the following prompt". Do not include a contact me element on this page. Also, please fix the CSS styling issues that are affecting the appearance of bullet points in the arguments. Make sure you create a header for the page so the reader knows what this is about. Make sure the header is blue and lower the nav bar to where it's flush with the header.</p>
